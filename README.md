## Analysis of How Misinformation in Posts Affects the Public

During the US presidential election, discussions about misinformation prominently feature statements made by Donald Trump. Throughout the campaign, he posted numerous messages on X (formerly Twitter), many of which were reported to contain false information. Given Trump's significant influence, we utilized this data to effectively analyze public reactions to misinformation. Specifically, Trump's tweets were categorized into those containing fake news and those that did not. We then quantitatively examined public responses by analyzing metrics such as views, replies, reposts, likes, and bookmarks for each category.
